              It's always been expensive to get married, but weddings seem pricier than ever. Between the venue, the engagement ring, the perfect dress, food and alcohol, and music, the average american wedding costs a pretty penny. According to data
              compiled by The Knot, the average cost of a wedding in the United States in 2019 was $33,900. But this number varies widely, depending on the state you're getting married in. The average bride in Alabama spends the least for her
              wedding, with the averge wedding costing approximately $17,216. But her Hawaiian counterpart will spend, on average, nearly $20,000 more on her wedding. The variation in cost is likely due to the cost of living in each state. Jackie
              Courtney, wedding expert and founder of the website Nearly Newlywed, told CNBC that location is the biggest factor in the cost of a wedding, due to its "huge impact on most costs relating to the wedding."
